|==========================================================
| Version | Date       | Author         | Comment

|==========================================================

== Introduction

plain-common-lisp is a lightweight framework created to make it easier for
software developers to develop and distribute {url-cl}[Common Lisp]’s
applications on Microsoft Windows:

1. Download the {url-releases}[latest release] of plain-common-lisp
2. Extract the archive in your workspace
3. Done: you have a decent <<bookmark-quicklisp,Quicklisp-enabled>> and <<bookmark-slime,SLIME-compatible>> Common Lisp's distribution on Windows!

image::docs/images/readme/03-workspace-directory-highlight.png[screenshot]
image::docs/images/readme/06-repl.png[screenshot]

At this point, the Common Lisp's REPL is ready and the user can already work
with all {url-ql-releases}[the third-party libraries] available from Quicklisp!
This makes Common Lisp a good candidate for writing {url-fare-1}[small programs]
and {url-fare-2}[utilities]. Thousands of Common Lisp's libraries are available,
to give an example, one can install a HTTP library and start to use it
immediately:

image::docs/images/readme/07-winhttp-highlight.png[screenshot]

The changes are persistent: the installed libraries will be available after a
restart.

image::docs/images/readme/08-next-startup-highlight.png[screenshot]

plain-common-lisp is basically a ready-to-use distribution of {url-sbcl}[SBCL]
and {url-quicklisp}[Quicklisp]. The distribution is small and only contains a few
files.

```
plain-common-lisp
│   plain-common-lisp.exe
│   README.md
├───applications
├───cache
├───configs
│       plain-common-lisp.cfg
├───sources
│   └───lisp
│           pcl-loader.lisp
└───third-party
    ├───binaries
    │   │   sbcl.core
    │   │   sbcl.exe
    │   └───contrib (SBCL's fasl files)
    └───quicklisp
            quicklisp.lisp
```

To keep the plain-common-lisp archive small, Quicklisp is not included. For that
reason, the first startup might be a little bit slow because plain-common-lisp
will:

* Download and install the last version of Quicklisp from the Internet

* Compile the Lisp code and store the compilation results into the "cache"
  directory

The following executions should be much faster.

=== Install SLIME on GNU Emacs

This chapter is based on a fresh installation of the vanilla GNU Emacs. The
default package repository contains an old SLIME version which is not working
properly. The third-party repository MELPA contains a good version. The first
step is to add this MELPA repository to GNU Emacs.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/01-emacs-starts.png[screenshot]

Press `Alt-x` and then enter the command `customize-variable`.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/02-customize-variable.png[screenshot]

Input `package-archives`.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/03-customize-variable-package-archives.png[screenshot]

Click on `INS` to insert a new repository:

- Name: MELPA
- URL: https://melpa.org/packages/

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/04-add-melpa.png[screenshot]

Click on "STATE" and then "Save for Future Sessions".

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/05-save-package-archives.png[screenshot]

Restart GNU Emacs. This is not techically required but slighly simplier to
document.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/06-emacs-starts.png[screenshot]

Press `Alt-x` and then enter the command `list-packages`. Wait a few seconds for
the package list to be downloaded.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/07-emacs-list-packages.png[screenshot]

Find the MELPA version of "SLIME" and press `i` the mark the software for installation.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/08-mark-slime-melpa.png[screenshot]

Press `x` to start the installation.

image::docs/images/slime-emacs-install-slime/09-confirm-install.png[screenshot]

That's done, SLIME is installed on GNU Emacs.

=== Install SWANK in plain-common-lisp

This chapter is based on a fresh installation of plain-common-lisp.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/01-pcl-fresh-start.png[screenshot]

Install SWANK from Quicklisp with the command `(ql:quickload "swank")`.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/02-pcl-quickload-swank.png[screenshot]

One can start a SWANK server with the function `(swank:create-server)` which
will create a local server. By default, this server will listen on the port
4005. This function will need to be called each time the application is
executed.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/03-pcl-swank-create-server.png[screenshot]

Create a new Lisp file in the "applications" directory.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/04-pcl-create-lisp-file.png[screenshot]

For example, one can write a hello-world function.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/05-create-hello-word.png[screenshot]

At this stage, let's try to make Emacs connect to the plain-common-lisp
process. Press `Alt-x` and type the command `slime-connect`.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/06-slime-connect.png[screenshot]

When prompted about which host to use, just validate: the default host
`localhost` is perfectly fine.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/07-slime-connect-localhost.png[screenshot]

When prompted about which port to use, just validate: the default port
`4005` is perfectly fine.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/08-slime-connect-port.png[screenshot]

That's it, SLIME is started and connected to the plain-common-lisp process.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/09-slime-started.png[screenshot]

To compile the `hello-world` function and send it to plain-common-lisp, it is
simply needed to type `Ctrl-c Ctrl-c`. The result of the compilation will appear
in the terminal below the source code. One can directly test the hello-world
function by jumping in the REPL and typing the Common Lisp code `(hello-world)`.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/10-slime-interaction.png[screenshot]

This is exactly why it is named _interactive_. The programmer write a function
in its source code and test it immediately. If the function is working, the
developer can save the file and then write a new function. The development of
the program is done step-by-step in a incremental way.

In most of Common Lisp's programs there are different packages. By default,
SLIME starts in the standard package `common-lisp-user` also named
`CL-USER`. All the functions will be created in this package. If one want to
switch to another package, he can:

- Press `Alt-x` and then type the command `slime-repl-set-package`
- Use the shortcut `Ctrl-c` then `Alt-p`

The package names can be automatically completed when pressing the `TAB` key.

In the example below, we have created a package "hello" exporting the "main"
function. Then we asked SLIME to jump inside this package. At this point, we
implemented the "main" function and tested it.

image::docs/images/slime-pcl-install-swank/11-slime-packages.png[screenshot]

=== Make the SLIME configuration persistent

A full example is available and can be downloaded from {url-releases}[the
releases area] of plain-common-lisp. We can make the assumption that the SWANK
server might not be needed when delivering the application to the users. So it
could be reasonable to consider 2 environments:

- Development environment, starting SWANK server automatically
- Production environment, without any SWANK server

Creating a new environment simply means duplicating 2 files. Duplicate
"plain-common-lisp.exe" into "plain-common-lisp-dev.exe". Duplicate
"configs/plain-common-lisp.cfg" into "configs/plain-common-lisp-dev.cfg".

image::docs/images/slime-persistent/01-dev-environment.png[screenshot]
image::docs/images/slime-persistent/02-dev-config.png[screenshot]

Then one simply need to write the "plain-common-lisp-dev" application startup
file named "plain-common-lisp-dev.lisp".

image::docs/images/slime-persistent/03-applications.png[screenshot]

.plain-common-lisp-dev.lisp
[source,lisp]
----
(asdf:load-system "swank")
(swank:create-server)
----

When the program "plain-common-lisp-dev.exe" will be executed, it will try to
load and execute the file "applications\plain-common-lisp-dev.lisp". This
startup file will load SWANK and create a server.

After that, we can just run the application "plain-common-lisp-dev.exe" and
connect with SLIME from GNU Emacs. The SWANK server is started automatically.

== Known issues

=== SLIME does not work when spawning plain-common-lisp executables

This method is unfortunately not currently supported. The reason is technical,
the SWANK package from Quicklisp implements its own FASL binaries relocation
scheme. It does it in a way which is not compatible with plain-common-lisp.

image::docs/images/slime-known-issues.png[screenshot]

The FASL files from plain-common-lisp and SWANK being located in different
directories, plain-common-lisp startup meets an error when loading SWANK. If one
successfuly modify SWANK so that he don't implement any custom FASL redirection,
this issue would probably be solved.

=== plain-common-lisp directories cannot be moved or renamed after initial installation

This issue is known and being analysed. Current work-around: delete all the
files from the cache directory.
